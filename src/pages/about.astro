		<h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
		<p>Hello World! I usually write this sentence when I can't find anything to write.</p>
		<p>
			Anyway, let's keep it quick and simple, my name is Muhammed Emin Boydak, you can probably
			understand by the name of my website.
		</p>
		<p>I am an embedded systems engineer, interested in software, firmware and electron things.</p>
		<p>I graduated from Sel√ßuk University, Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering.</p>
		<p>
			I currently work in <a
				class="cactus-link inline-block"
				href="https://mepsan.com.tr"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				aria-label="company website">Mepsan</a
			>.
		</p>
		<p>This website is about me, what I'm working on and what I like to talk about.</p>

		<h1 class="title">Contact</h1>
		<p>
			I have recently stopped using social media, so it is quite impossible for you to reach me
			through social media, so you can reach me in the following ways:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>Discord: eminboydak</li>
			<li>E-mail: <a href="mailto:me@eminboydak.com">me@eminboydak.com</a></li>
		</ul>
